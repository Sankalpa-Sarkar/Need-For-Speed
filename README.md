# Need-For-Speed
A self-interest game built in Unity 3D and scripted in C#, Need For Speed is a racing game which has a set timer for a race car to finish a lap around the track, avoiding obstacles and using ramps. The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding Reference. The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs the movement of a car on a track using basic car moving mechanics, scripted in C#, with a camera rig attached and coded to follow the car from a rear end. A large number of obstacles and ramps are present to make it challenging for the player, while pragmatism ensured that the same did not go overboard. A RigidBody and a Box Collider ensured that the same were reflected in the movement of the car and their collision with the obstacles.
